<h1> <i>PSL 7: Franchises boost teams with supplementary and replacement draft.. </i>:</h1>
<hr />

<p> 
The six HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchises on Saturday picked additional players and submitted partial replacements for unavailable players in a supplementary and replacement draft, said a statement from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).

The statement said the draft was held through a virtual session and the order of selection was decided through random draw.

Karachi Kings had the first pick for the supplementary draft and chose Sahibzada Farhan, winner of the PCB Domestic Cricketer of the Year Award 2021.

Lahore Qalandar who had the second pick chose Mohammad Imran Randhawa.

“In the next four picks; Islamabad United added pacer Musa Khan, who played for them in the 2019, 2020 and 2021 seasons; Quetta Gladiators reserved their pick; Multan Sultans picked England pacer David Willey, and Peshawar Zalmi picked Mohammad Umar.

“The second round followed [a] reverse order in which Peshawar Zalmi, the winners of the second edition of HBL PSL, going first, reserved their pick. Defending champions Multan Sultans picked Rizwan Hussain, 2019 edition’s Quetta Gladiators picked Ghulam Mudassar, two-time champions Islamabad United plucked Zahir Khan, Lahore Qalandars further boosted their pace department with the addition of Akif Javed and Karachi Kings bagged Jordan Thompson,” the PCB said.

According to the statement, each franchise was allowed to pick a maximum of one foreign cricketer out of the two supplementary picks.

Moving on to the replacement draft, the defending champions replaced Odean Smith with wicketkeeper-batter Johnson Charles and Rovman Powell with Dominic Drakes.

The Gladiators opted to change Naveen-ul-Haq with Luke Wood, James Vince with Will Smeed, Jason Roy with Shimron Hetmyer, and Afghanistan’s Noor Ahmed with Ali Imran.

Karachi Kings proceeded to replace Pakistan U19 captain Qasim Akram with left-arm spinner Mohammad Taha Khan since the former is busy in West Indies playing in the ICC Men’s U19 Cricket World Cup. The statement added the team also reserved its pick for Tom Abell.

Meanwhile, Islamabad United replaced Zeeshan Zameer with Mohammad Huraira.

“The unavailability of English wicketkeeper-batter Phil Salt for a few initial matches saw Ben Dunk reuniting with Lahore Qalandars.

“Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators reserved their one supplementary pick each, while five franchises, except Quetta Gladiators, reserved their picks in the replacement round,” the statement said.

<h1><i> Tom Latham eyes double ton as NZ head for massive total..</i> : </h1>
<hr />
<p>
CHRISTCHURCH: New Zealand promised to bounce back quickly from their first-Test loss to Bangladesh and captain Tom Latham redeemed the pledge with a commanding unbeaten century Sunday on the first day of the second Test.

Latham lost the toss for the sixth time while standing in as captain for Kane Williamson and had to bat on a disconcertingly green pitch at Hagley Oval. By stumps he was 186 not out and with the help of a half century to Will Young and Devon Conway, who faced a nervous night on 99 not out, New Zealand was 349-1.

“I’m a bit nervous naturally but I’ll try to take a sleeping tablet to help me go to bed and reassess tomorrow,” Conway said. “It was special today, considering the fact after we lost the toss. I think both teams wanted to bowl first. The way Tom Latham and Will Young went about their work was really special and Tom was outstanding to bat throughout the day and I was just grateful to bat beside him.”

Bangladesh’s shock win in the first Test thrilled the cricket world. The ninth-ranked team in the world had beaten the second-ranked team. Even more, the immense underdogs had beaten the champions of the long format in their home conditions where they were unbeaten in their last 17 Tests.

It was the stuff of fairytales but on Sunday the quiet, pragmatic Latham brought Bangladesh back to a cruel reality. Latham hadn’t previously scored even a half century but the captain dominated the day, carrying his bat through 90 overs. By stumps he had hit 28 fours for 112 runs from boundaries.

Latham accumulated steadily and briskly, reaching his half century from 65 balls, his century from 133, his 150 from 199. And he played a full array shots, favoring the cut when Bangladesh bowled too short with the new ball in the morning then leaning into his drives and bringing midwicket into play in the next two sessions.

He scored 70 of his 100 partnership with Young and 57 of a century partnership from 155 balls with Conway.

“The way Tom hit some of his drives, the sound of ball meeting the bat was awesome,” New Zealand batting coach Luke Ronchi told reporters.

“To be not out and bat the whole day and to be continuing tomorrow with Devon…it was a fantastic effort from both ends.

“There’s obviously going to be times on a green surface when you’re going to get a bit of luck but you’ve also to keep batting and make the most of it.”

Latham was given out lbw to Ebadot Hossain twice in the ninth over and both decisions were reversed after the batsman reviewed them.

Ebadot created another chance soon after the lunch break but Liton Das spilled Young, then on 26, at second slip with the batsman rubbing salt in the wound with a rare seven runs after running three and picking up four overthrows.

Shoriful Islam finally broke the stand when he had Young caught at gully for 54 but Latham continued to punish the wayward Bangladesh bowlers. Latham was on 169 when Bangladesh blew a review trying to get him caught behind.

“Unfortunately we did not bowl enough good balls to create the sort of pressure that we created last week,” Bangladesh fast bowling coach Ottis Gibson told reporters. “New Zealand would have been hurting from last week and they came back and showed why there are one of the best teams in the world.”

Bangladesh were forced into making two changes to the squad that had triumphed in Mount Maunganui.

Opener Mahmudul Hasan (hand) and middle order batsman Mushfiqur Rahim (groin) missed out with injuries and were replaced by Nurul Hasan and Mohammad Naim.
