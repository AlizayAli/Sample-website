<h1> <i>‘Murree has seen more snow in past but mismanagement caused tragedy’.. </i>:</h1>
<hr />

<p> ISLAMABAD: Had the government departments and local administration acted promptly on Friday, we would not have witnessed a tragedy of this scale in Murree.

“It was a complete failure of the government and it was complete mismanagement as despite warnings from Met Office and continuous snowfall nobody bothered to check the status of the tourists in the hill station,” said Qari Abdul Wajid Abbasi while leading a group of volunteers in rescue activities.

Over 20 people, including children, lost their lives in stranded cars in the area on Friday night.

Mr Abbasi told Dawn that if the stranded passengers could be rescued on Saturday after the issue was highlighted, why no action was taken on Friday night.

In reply to a question, he said he came to know about the tragedy through social media.

“When I came to know that people have died in stranded cars, I contacted friends to join me in the rescue operation.”

He added: “I formed a group of volunteers and purchased biscuits and dry fruits and moved from Bhurban to Jikka Gali and Kuldana for evacuating the trapped cars.”

The volunteers reached Kuldana from Jikka Gali on foot and helped a number of people there.

“By the time we reached there, many families had already been rescued but we helped visitors in evacuating their cars.”

The 45-year-old Qari said in the past the area had received more snowfall but this year it was mismanagement that led to the tragedy.

“I still remember in early 2000s Murree witnessed more snowfall than this year. That time I reached my house from Jikka Gali on foot.”

Mr Abbasi appreciated local people for taking part in the rescue operation actively besides offering their houses, food etc., to the visitors.

“A large number of locals in various areas took part in the rescue operation. They also offered food and shelter to the visitors,” he said and added that some hotel owners on Saturday also offered food and free shelters to the visitors.

However, at the same time, some hotel owners exploited the situation and charged more than Rs20,000 rent per room per night which was shameful, he added.

He also criticised so-called “helpers” of Murree who evacuated the trapped cars after getting thousands of rupees from the owners.

“Greedy people equipped with chains and other tools helped the trapped people only after striking a deal with them. Such people are a blot on the face of the hospitable people of Murree as they charged Rs5,000 to Rs20,000 for pushing trapped cars out of snow,” he said.

Despite the forecast of heavy snowfall in Murree and Galiyat, the local administration did not take any precautionary measures until Friday. They allowed more than 100,000 vehicles to enter Murree during the four-day spell of snow that resulted in congestion in the area.

On the other hand, the government departments did not act to rescue trapped people on Friday night that resulted in the death of more than 20 visitors in their cars.

However, on Saturday, the administration acted promptly and started an operation rescue.

<h1><i> PM can only talk about army chief’s appointment, not extension: Abbasi..</i> : </h1>
<hr />
<p> PML-N leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Monday said Prime Minister Imran Khan was creating a “unnecessary fuss” over army chief’s tenure, saying that as per the Constitution a premier was only mandated to talk about the “appointment” of the military head and not of their “extension”.

Prime Minister Imran Khan had on Jan 6 said he had so far not thought about extension in the tenure of Chief of the Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa.

“The current year has just started and November is far away. Then why is there a worry about extension in the tenure of the army chief,” the prime minister had said in an interview with Dunya TV Islamabad Bureau Chief Khawar Ghumman.

PML-N Secretary-General Ahsan Iqbal had on Sunday also hit out at the prime minister for speaking about the extension of the chief of army staff tenure prematurely.

Abbasi, a former prime minister himself, during a media talk in Karachi today, questioned the use of the term “extension” by PM Imran regarding the army chief’s tenure.

He said the Constitution was clear on the army chief’s appointment, saying: “The Constitution that we’ve read [says] the army chief gets appointed for three years. There has never been a debate on extension of the army chief’s tenure.”

When reminded by a reporter that the army chief’s extension has now been legislated on, Abbasi said: “That is a part of law but when the prime minister talks, he talks about the appointment and not of extension.”

It is pertinent to mention here that current Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s tenure was extended for three years by the prime minister in Aug 2019, just three months before he was set to retire.

The extension was questioned in the Supreme Court, which after much debate had allowed the COAS to retain his position for six months and given the government six months to legislate on the matter. The legislation was carried out in Jan 2020.

‘Govt incompetence to blame for Murree deaths’
The PML-N leader also fired a broadside at the government over deaths of tourists in Murree due to blizzard and said it was “sheer negligence and incompetence” on the government’s part as “it is the first time that tourists died after getting stranded in snowfall”.

He said the tragedy took place just because the administration did not clear roads in time, while police reached the spot after about 28 hours.

He said the authorities were supposed to take action against hotel owners in Murree who were overcharging visitors during the emergency situation.

Abbasi claimed that people’s rage would be visible on the day of election, saying “the PTI will suffer the same fate that it met in the local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”

To a question about interior minister’s request to the opposition for postponement of Pakistan Democratic Movement’s March 23 rally, the former premier said the traditional parade on March 23 will conclude by 11 in the morning, adding “the parade of public will begin after it.”

Earlier, he targeted the National Accountability Bureau, saying judges were also confused whether to proceed as there were no grounds in graft cases filed by the NAB against him and other PML-N leaders.

<h1> <i>PM blasts Modi for ‘continuing silence’ on Hindutva summit calling for Indian minorities’ genocide..</i>: </h1>
<hr />
<p> Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday said the Narendra Modi-led government was “a real and present threat to peace” in the region, adding that all minorities in India were at the target of extremist groups operating under the patronage of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Last month, leaders from several far-right groups in India had issued calls for the ethnic cleansing of minorities in the country, especially targeting its 200 million-strong Muslim population.

A report by The Quint had said that the “hate speech conclave” was organised by Hindutva leader Yati Narsinghanand from Dec 17 to 19 in Uttarakhand’s pilgrimage city of Haridwar, where multiple calls to kill minorities and attack their religious spaces were made.

PM Imran, in a series of tweets today, blasted Modi for his “continuing silence” and inaction against extremist Hindutva groups calling for genocide of minorities in the country.

“Under the extremist ideology of the BJP Modi govt, all religious minorities in India have been targeted with impunity by Hindutva groups,” he said.

The prime minister called out the continuing silence of Modi government, adding that it warranted clarity whether the BJP government supported the extremists’ call.

He urged the international community to take notice of the calls and act against it.

According to an October report in The Print, Hindu leader Narsinghanand has been accused of inciting communal tension against the Muslim community on several occasions.

“Like Myanmar, our police, our politicians, our army and every Hindu must pick up weapons and conduct a safayi abhiyan (clean-up). There is no other option left,” Swami Prabodhanand Giri, president of the Hindu Raksha Sena, was quoted as saying by NDTV.

Sadhvi Annapurna, the general secretary of the political party Hindu Mahasabha, also gave a call to arms and incitement to genocide.

“Nothing is possible without weapons. If you want to eliminate their population, then kill them. Be ready to kill and be ready to go to jail. Even if 100 of us are ready to kill 20 lakhs of them (Muslims), then we will be victorious, and go to jail,” The Wire quoted her as saying.

According to the report, religious leader Swami Anandswaroop gave an example of how Muslim street vendors should be treated. “The street in which I live, every morning I used to spot a mullah with a big beard and nowadays they keep a saffron beard. This is Haridwar, Maharaj. There is no Muslim buyer here, so throw him out,” he said.

The Wire reported that BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay and BJP Mahila Morcha leader Udita Tyagi also attended the three-day summit “giving the event a level of political encouragement from the ruling party”.

However, speaking to the Indian Express, Upadhyay said: “It was a three-day event and I was there for one day, during which I was on the stage for around 30 minutes and talked about the Constitution. What others said before and after me, I am not responsible for it.
